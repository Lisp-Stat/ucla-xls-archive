\title{Statistical Computing and Dynamic Graphics Using Lisp-Stat}
\author{Luke Tierney\\School of Statistics\\University of Minnesota}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Lisp-Stat is an environment for general statistical computing and for
using and developing dynamic graphical methods. The Lisp-Stat system
contains a set of functions for performing basic statistical
calculations and constructing dynamic statistical graphs such as
linked scatterplots and rotatable three-dimensional plots. In
addition, new numerical and graphical tools can be added to the system
using the Lisp programming language and a simple object-oriented
programming system.

The course will begin with an overview of the capabilities of the
system and then introduce basic elements of Lisp programming and
concepts of object-oriented programming. These ideas will then be used
on several examples to illustrate how to add new graphical and
numerical methods to the system. The examples may include a simple set
of tools for fitting generalized linear models and an implementation
of the Grand Tour for viewing data sets in four or more dimensions.

Several extended breaks will be scheduled and a small number of
microcomputers or workstations will be made available during these
breaks to allow participants to experiment with the ideas presented.
