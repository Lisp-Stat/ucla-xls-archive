This directory contains transparencies and examples used in a
shortcourse on Lisp-Stat presented at the 1992 ENAR meetings in
Cincinnati, 22 March 1992.

Run LaTeX on course.tex to get the transparencies used in the course.
The files assume you have the psfig macros for including PostScript
files available.

The ENAR directory contains examples made available on some PC's
during the breaks. The file problems.tex contains suggested exercises
that accompany these demos.

The LSP directory contains examples used in the demonstration.
