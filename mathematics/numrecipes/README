This is translated from ugly FORTRAN to ugly CL. f2cl is buggy, so
many things can be wrong. If you find fault, let me know. I cannot
check all 250 routines, but if I come across bugs I'll correct them.
Also remember the roadmap of dependencies in NR, and remember to
load macros.lsp for f2cl support.

NB

Lisp routines with names in capitals have not been tested.
