Subject: PDFplot : 1st official alpha release.

PDF graphics output from XlispStat <http://www.xlispstat.org/>

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/pdfplot.lsp>

is a XlispStat class to generate PDF files from LispStat plot
objects.

It requires:
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/basicplt.lsp>

On the Mac (and probably windows) where there is no built-in
parse-color, it may also require:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/parscolr.lsp>

And optionally, you may use it with the grid and background
color extensions defined in:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/backgrid.lsp>

A sample file that shows how to use these functions is in:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/pdftest.lsp>

And two examples output files generated by the functions in
pdftest.lsp are:

<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/0test.pdf>
<http://galen.med.virginia.edu/~sdm7g/XES/Sources/1test.pdf>

If you have the pdf-plugin enabled for your web browser,
you should be able to view those two files with your browser.

This version is not yet feature complete. It doesn't yet handle
all possible features of scatterplots and other graphic objects.
However, it does, to the best of my knowledge and the limited
ability to test it without the Adobe SDKs and Tools ($$$), produce
properly formatted PDF files, with correct xrefs and trailers.

This version makes a temporary output string in memory, so it
is limited in the complexity of the plots it can handle. (You
can allocate more memory to XlispStat to overcome this to some
extent.) This should change in future versions.

Documentation on pdfplot, as well as how to use subclasses of
basic-plot-proto to generate other graphics output (PostScript,
LaTeX, PGML, Flash, QuickDraw, et.al. ) is in progress.
( PDFPLOT is basically the first practical test of BASICPLT )
I hope to also use this program for a tutorial in building
PDF files.
