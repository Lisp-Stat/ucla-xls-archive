<p><b>Motivation:</b>
(1) To provide a series of tools for easily
  translating code written in CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) to the
  XLISP object system.  (2) To provide some of the features of the
  Defclass macro, such as automatic creation of accessor functions and
  initialization functions and tightly coupled object defintition and
  documentation.<p>
