Instructions for installation under Unix (your instructions may vary
under other operating systems.)

1) Unpack the directories 'xlos' and 'definition' from the provided file:

zcat docsys1.tar.Z | tar xfv - xlos defintion

2) Start Xlisp-stat

3) Load the file "defintion/system.lsp"

(load "definition/system.lsp")

4) Load a file containing a documentation object:

e.g., 
(load "defnition/doc-doc.lsp")

This builds the manuals for the project documentation project.

See the files defintion/brief.tex, doc.tex, user.tex and
user-manual.tex or user-manual.html for more information.

The file definition/doc.lsp is a template.  Copy it to your project
directory and edit it for your project.  See doc-doc.lsp for an
example.

The file definition/documenting.html is a primer on documentation for
XLISP.  It contains details about which concepts the documentation
system picks up.

The file definition/jamtr.pdf contains John MacDonald's original
technical report on documenting CLOS/Common Lisp Code.


Good Luck,
