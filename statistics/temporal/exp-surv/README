This release contains three files:

       README      - the file you're reading now
 
       expsurv.lsp - a set of XLISP-STAT routines for performing
                     interactive dynamic exploratory  graphical analysis of 
                     survival data. These techniques are described in
                     the 1993 proceedings of the ASA Section on Statistical
                     Graphics and in The American Statistician, vol. 49,
                     no. 1, pp. 77-84 (Feb. 1995).

       expsurv.tex - a brief user's manual for the routines.

If you have any comments or suggestions on this work, I would be glad
to hear them. I am trying to develop a set of techniques which will permit
clinical researchers to examine survival data in a direct and intuitive
fashion.
