This paper describes how {\tt Lisp-Stat} can be used to simulate discrete 
finite state Markov Chains.  {\tt Lisp-Stat},  developed by
Luke~Tierney of the University of Minnesota,  is a powerful
object-oriented programming language with statistical capabilities. 

The software we have developed will graphically simulate a Markov
chain using the {\tt Lisp-Stat} language.  It can be used to
illustrate the validity of several important theoretical results
concerning the properties of a Markov chain.  In this paper, we
give a complete description of our design and the code used to
implement the design.  A beneficial side-effect of this detailed
description is that some of the objects we have designed may be used
in a ``plug-and-chug'' manner by programmers in other situations.
