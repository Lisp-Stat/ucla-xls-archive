We present two applications in this section. Although, we have
experimented with quite a few applications described in Kemeny and
Snell\cite{kemsnell}, it would be cumbersome to reproduce them all
here. 

The first application is a realization of the gambler's ruin problem.
The user can visually play along and estimate the probability of the
gambler going broke.  The second is an illustration of the Ergodic
theorem for Markov Chains.
