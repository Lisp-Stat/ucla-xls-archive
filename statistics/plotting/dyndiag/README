The file reg-doc.tex is a Latex version of the documentation that accompanies 
this software.  It is a LaTeX file that can be printed by the following unix
commands:
	latex reg-doc
	dvips reg-doc  (maybe different on some systems)


The following files all contain lisp code.  Copy them into the folder from 
which you start XLISP-STAT:

   reg1.lsp reg2.lsp rgraph1.lsp fun1.lsp overlay1.lsp overlay2.lsp 
   overlay3.lsp

The file cwinit.lsp, when loaded, will load all these files.  To load 
automatically at startup, add the following line to your statinit.lsp file:

	(load "cwinit")

The remaining .lsp files, when loaded, create regression model objects, as 
described in the documentation.

We hope you find this code useful.  As this is a test version, comments will
be most appreciated.  We plan to submit the code to statlib some time in
October 1991.
