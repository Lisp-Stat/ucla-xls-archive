;; This module has a complicated history. The first version was written
;; by Jan de Leeuw, mid 1994, to provide an Xlisp-Stat version of the
;; S-routines in Haerdle's book, and to provide a histogram-proto that
;; inherits from the scatterplot-proto.
;;
;; The second version was done begin 1995 by Jason Bond, who added a
;; slider for the binwidth.
;;
;; Version 3.0 was done by Jan de Leeuw in March 1995. It involved a
;; complete overhaul of the code. XOR drawing was eliminated, menu
;; support improved, slider support improved, code made more modular,
;; my-histogram-proto and my-polygon-proto separated.
;;
;; 3.0     ** March 22 1995 ** Still no support for warping and fitting
;;         a normal.
;; 3.1     ** March 23 1995 ** Support for fitting a normal.
;;
;; 3.2     ** March 26 1995 ** Make sure the menu-items toggle in the
;;         correct way. Improved updating of plots, much greater
;;         efficiency. Created menu items for options. Wrote my-histogram
;;         function. Foundations put in for warping and overlays.
;;         Optimized normal-density fitting.
;;
;; 3.3     ** May 22, 1995 ** Support for different bin-widths.  Function
;;         call for different bin-widths is:
;;         (my-histogram data :my-cutpoints cut-points) where cutpoints
;;         is a list of cutoff points.  Of course, changing the bin-widths
;;         using the slider makes everything go back to a single bin-width.
