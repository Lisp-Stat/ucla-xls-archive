.FN nwaylist
.TL
construct n-way list from formula
.CS
nwaylist(formula, data=sys.parent())
.AG formula
the formula describing the dependent variable and the cell structure.
The only model operators that make sense here are "`+'" and "`:'".  Use of other
operators will produce lists with excessive numbers of empty cells.
.AG data
if supplied, a data frame in which the variables named in the formula
are to be found.
If `data' is omitted, the current search list is used; for example,
a data frame may have been attached or variables may be objects
in the working database.
.RT
an array of lists.  The `dim' and `dimnames' of the list are based on
the `terms' in the `formula'.  The contents of each component in the list
is the vector of all elements in the `response' of the `formula'.
.SA
`boxmat'.
.EX
nwaylist(y~a+b:c)
.KW boxmat
.WR
