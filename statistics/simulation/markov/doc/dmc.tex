The file {\tt dmc-proto.lsp} contains the code that creates the markov
chain object.  It also includes the associated methods for the markov
chain object. 
 
\begin{verbatim} 
(require "dmc-opts")
(require "buttons")
(require "stochast")
(require "states")
(provide "dmc")
\end{verbatim}

These first few lines lines make sure that the auxilliary code in {\tt
  dmc-opts.lsp} (see section~\ref{subsec:dmc-opts}), {\tt states}
(see section~\ref{subsec:states}), {\tt buttons.lsp} (see
section~\ref{subsec:buttons}), and {\tt stochast.lsp} (see
section~\ref{subsec:stochast}) , which is necessary for {\tt
  dmc.lsp} to work sanely, is loaded and available when {\tt dmc.lsp} is
loaded.
\begin{verbatim}
(defproto dmc-proto '(initial-state state-objs button-objs
                                    current-state time history
                                    sample-paths)
  nil graph-window-proto)
\end{verbatim}
We define a new object {\tt dmc-proto} with some slots for holding its
data. The slots are described below. 
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt initial-state}] Holds the state in which the process will
  start, 
\item[{\tt state-objs}] Holds a list of all the state button objects
  which are manipulated by the {\tt dmc-proto} object,
\item[{\tt button-objs}] Holds a list of control buttons objects for
  the state-object,
\item[{\tt current-state}] Holds the state in which the markov chain
  is currently,
\item[{\tt time}]  Holds the current time, in ticks,
\item[{\tt history}]  Holds the name of a file into which history is
  recorded. It is {\tt nil} if no such recording is requested, which
  is the default.
\end{description}
This object inherits from the {\tt Lisp-Stat} prototype {\tt
  graph-window-proto} and therefore has all the methods of {\tt
  graph-window-proto} available to it. Some of these inherited methods
enable us to paint particular areas of a window, draw lines, points,
etc. Thus, we are spared from dealing with these tedious details---a
good example of the power of object-oriented paradigm.  

\subsubsection{The {\tt :isnew} method}
\label{subsubsec:dmc-isnew}
When any object is designed, an {\tt :isnew} method needs to be
defined for the object outlining the tasks to be done when an instance
of the object is created. Note that many instances of an object
prototype can be created in one session. We now describe the {\tt
  :isnew} method for {\tt dmc-proto}.  
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :isnew (transition-matrix initial &optional 
                           title)
  "Method args: (transition-matrix initial &optional title)
  Returns an instance of the dmc-proto object given a 
  transition matrix.  Initial state is initial. Title 
  is used for title if given."
\end{verbatim}
The mandatory arguments to the {\tt :isnew} method are a
transition-matrix of object type {\tt matrix} and an integer for the
initial state. An optional {\tt title} may be specified to distinguish
various instances of the {\tt dmc-proto} object.  The string that is
specified as the last argument provides some basic help for the user who
wishes to know more the {\tt :isnew} method.  In particular, it tells
the user what arguments are necessary for the method to be invoked. 
For example, in {\tt Lisp-Stat}, after one loads the file {\tt
  dmc.lsp}, the help facility may be used as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
> (send dmc-proto :help :isnew)
:ISNEW
Method args: (transition-matrix initial &optional title)
  Returns an instance of the dmc-proto object given a 
  transition matrix.  Initial state is initial. Title
  is used for title if given.
NIL
\end{verbatim}
We shall be content with this one example and refrain from discussing
the help string hereafter. To save space, we have omitted these help
strings in the otherwise verbatim reproduction of our code.
\begin{verbatim}
;;; Indentation level 1
  (unless (stochastic-matrixp transition-matrix)
          (error 
           "Transition matrix is not a stochastic matrix!"))
  (setf (slot-value 'time) 0)
  (if title
      (send self :title title)
    (send self :title "Discrete Markov Chain"))
  (setf (slot-value 'initial-state) initial)
  (setf (slot-value 'current-state) initial)
\end{verbatim}
The first line  above checks whether the transition matrix is a
stochastic matrix using a function defined in the file {\tt
  stochast.lsp}.  If the matrix is not so, an error is signalled.  
Otherwise, the values for {\tt
  initial-state} and {\tt current-state} are recorded in the
appropriate slots. The clock is reset to zero.  If a title is given,
it is used; otherwise, a default title {\sc Discrete Markov Chain} is
given. 
\begin{verbatim}
;;; Indentation level 1
  (let* ((n (select (array-dimensions transition-matrix) 0))
         (rows (row-list transition-matrix))
         (tmp nil))
    (dotimes (j n)
             (setf tmp (append tmp 
                               (list 
                                (send state-proto :new 
                                      (format nil "~d" j) j
                                      (select rows j))))))
    (setf (slot-value 'state-objs) tmp))
\end{verbatim}
Once the transition-matrix is available, the above code creates a list
of $n$ state objects, where $n$ is the number of states.  Each state
stores its own probability vector which means that the transition
matrix can be discarded after this point.  Note that a {\tt :new}
message is sent to the prototype {\tt state-proto} (see
section \ref{subsec:states}) $n$ times to create $n$ individual instances
of the {\tt state-proto} object.  The list of state objects is finally 
stored in the slot {\tt state-objs}. 
\begin{verbatim}
;;; Indentation level 1
  (let* ((n (send self :no-of-states))
         (ta (send self :text-ascent))
         (td (send self :text-descent))
         (col-sep (send self :text-width "mm"))
         (row-sep (+ ta td))
         (bh (round (* 1.5 (+ ta td))))
         (bw1 (send self :text-width " Reset "))
         (bw2 (send self :text-width " run-dmc "))
         (bw2a (send self :text-width " # "))
         (bw3 (send self :text-width  " Time: mmmmmmmmmm "))
         (state-width (send self :text-width 
                            (format nil "m~dm" n)))
         (c (floor (sqrt n)))
         (r (floor (/ n c)))
         (wx (+ (* 4 col-sep) bw1 bw2 bw2a bw3))
         (cols-width (+ (* c (+ col-sep state-width)) 
                        col-sep)))
    (when (< cols-width wx)
          (setf c (floor (/ (- wx col-sep) 
                            (+ col-sep state-width))))
          (setf r (floor (/ n c))))
    (setf wx (max wx cols-width))
\end{verbatim}
It may be wise to look at figure~\ref{fig:gambler} to 
understand this piece of code. The size of our graph-window and
the layout of the state-buttons are calculated. Thus, it is necessary
to have information about the ascent and descent of the characters in
the font currently being used in the window. The idea is
that the window should be as square as possible, thus occupying
minimum area of the screen, but at the same time, it should accomodate
the control buttons that sit on the first row of window. The variables
{\tt c} and {\tt r} are the number of columns, number of rows
respectively, in which the state buttons will be arrayed. The variable
{\tt wx} is the window width. Some amount of row and column separation
is provided for better appearance. 
\begin{verbatim}
;;; Indentation level 2    
    (setf (slot-value 'button-objs)
          (list 
           (send button-obj-proto :new 
                 "Reset" 
                 (list col-sep row-sep bw1 bh)
                 #'(lambda () (send self :reset)))
           (send button-obj-proto :new 
                 "run-dmc" 
                 (list (+ col-sep bw1 col-sep) row-sep bw2 bh)

                 #'(lambda () 
                     (let ((k (get-value-dialog 
                               "Number of steps to run?" 
                               :initial 1)))
                       (if k 
                           (send self :run-dmc 
                                 (select k 0))))))
           (send button-obj-proto :new 
                 (format nil "Time: ~d" (slot-value 'time))
                 (list (- wx col-sep bw3) row-sep bw3 bh)
                 #'(lambda ()))))
\end{verbatim}
The positions of each of the control buttons is determined and objects
are created for those buttons.  The first two buttons {\tt Reset} and
{\tt run-dmc} perform the tasks suggested by their names. There is
also a mini-button created that goes with the {\tt run-dmc} button.
This button can be used to run the markov chain for a specified number
of steps instead of just once.  The user is queried for the number of
steps in a dialog box. A default of 1 step is supplied. The {\tt
  time} button is somewhat special. It has no action to perform and
its title is dynamic; that is, as time ticks by, its title keeps
changing to display the new time.  At present, it can display a
maximum of a billion time ticks, which is not altogether inadequate.
\begin{verbatim}
;;; Indentation level 2
    (let* ((state-height (round (* 3 (+ ta td))))
           (controls-height (+ row-sep 
                               (round (* 1.5 (+ ta td)))))
           (wy (+ (if (eql (* c r) n)
                      (* r (+ row-sep state-height))
                    (* (+ r 1) 
                       (+ row-sep state-height))) row-sep))
           (tmp (slot-value 'state-objs)))
      (send self :size wx (+ wy controls-height))
      (call-next-method)
      (send self :delete-method :do-motion)
\end{verbatim}
Next, the height of the window is determined and the window is
informed of its new size. Since we wouldn't want anything done when
the mouse is moved over the window, we trash the {\tt :do-motion}
method. The {\tt call-next-method} makes sure that the inherited {\tt
  :isnew} method of {\tt graph-window-proto} gets executed when the
{\tt :isnew} method is invoked for {\tt dmc-proto}. This is 
what actually creates the window (recall that our prototype inherited
from {\tt graph-window-proto}). 
\begin{verbatim}    
;;; Indentation level 2
      (dotimes (i n)
               (let* ((y (+ 
                          (* (floor (/ i c)) 
                             (+ state-height row-sep)) 
                          row-sep))
                      (x (+ (* (mod i c) 
                               (+ state-width col-sep)) 
                            col-sep)))
                 (send (select tmp i) 
                       :loc-and-size 
                       (list x (+ y controls-height) 
                             state-width state-height))))))
\end{verbatim}
It is time now to determine the locations for the state buttons. The
state buttons, which are available as a list in the variable {\tt tmp}
are given their locations which they store in their own respective
slots. Later, we shall see that by defining a {\tt :redraw} method
(see section \ref{subsubsec:state-redraw}) for
the state buttons, we can let it draw itself in the window, thus
freeing ourselves from those decisions for now. 
\begin{verbatim}
;;; Indentation level 1
  (send (select (slot-value 'state-objs) initial)
        :you-are-current-state self)
  (send self :add-some-menu-items))
\end{verbatim}
The initial state object is sent a message that it is the current
state which makes it take the appropriate action.  Finally, some
additional items are installed in the menu for the window; see the
description of the {\tt :add-some-menu-items} for details.
This concludes the {\tt :isnew} method for our {\tt dmc-proto}. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :current-state-obj} method}
\label{subsubsec:current-state-obj}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :current-state-obj ()
  (select (slot-value 'state-objs) 
          (slot-value 'current-state)))
\end{verbatim}
This method returns the object representing the current state. Note
that the current state number and the current state object are
different. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :resize} method}
\label{subsubsec:resize}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :resize ()
  (let* ((but-objs (slot-value 'button-objs))
         (wsize (send self :size))
         (n (send self :no-of-states))
         (ta (send self :text-ascent))
         (td (send self :text-descent))
         (col-sep (send self :text-width "mm"))
         (row-sep (+ ta td))
         (bh (round (* 1.5 (+ ta td))))
         (bw1 (send self :text-width " Reset "))
         (bw2 (send self :text-width " run-dmc "))
         (bw2a (send self :text-width " # "))
         (bw3 (send self :text-width  " Time: mmmmmmmmmm "))
         (state-width (send self :text-width 
                            (format nil "m~dm" n)))
         (wx (max (first wsize) (+ (* 4 col-sep) 
                                   bw1 bw2 bw2a bw3)))
         (c (floor (/ (- wx col-sep) 
                      (+ col-sep state-width))))
         (r (floor (/ n c))))

    (send (select but-objs 0) :loc-and-size 
          (list col-sep row-sep bw1 bh))
    (send (select but-objs 1) :loc-and-size 
          (list (+ col-sep bw1 col-sep) row-sep bw2 bh))
    (send (select but-objs 2) :loc-and-size
          (list (+ col-sep bw1 col-sep bw2) row-sep bw2a bh))
    (send (select but-objs 3) :loc-and-size
          (list (- wx col-sep bw3) row-sep bw3 bh))
\end{verbatim}
Whenever a window is resized, the window layout would need to be
adjusted.  Otherwise, the same layout that we initially created would be
used everytime the resizing occurs.  The {\tt :resize} method adjusts
the number of rows and columns in which the state buttons are arrayed
while making sure that the window does not become too small or too
large. This {\tt :resize} method has a lot in common with the {\tt
  :isnew} method (see section~\ref{subsubsec:dmc-isnew}).  The main
difference is that now we don't have to determine the window size
ourselves;  the resizing of the window by the user forces a window
dimension on us. However, we have to guard against the window being
too narrow for the control buttons to fit. Therefore, there is a
minimum size beyond which the window cannot be made any smaller.  We
ensure this when we define the variable {\tt wx} representing the
window width. Once the window width is known, the number of columns
{\tt c} and the number of rows {\tt r} are determined for the layout.
The control buttons may now have new locations in the window, and so
they must be sent a {\tt :loc-and-size} message with the appropriate
coordinates.  
\begin{verbatim}
;;Indentation level 1
    (let* ((state-height (round (* 3 (+ ta td))))
           (controls-height (+ row-sep 
                               (round (* 1.5 (+ ta td)))))
           (wy (+ (if (eql (* c r) n)
                      (* r (+ row-sep state-height))
                    (* (+ r 1) (+ row-sep state-height))) 
                  row-sep))
           (tmp (slot-value 'state-objs)))
      (send self :size wx (+ wy controls-height))
      (dotimes (i n)
               (let* ((y (+ 
                          (* (floor (/ i c)) 
                             (+ state-height row-sep)) 
                          row-sep))
                      (x (+ (* (mod i c) 
                               (+ state-width col-sep)) 
                            col-sep)))
                 (send (select tmp i) 
                       :loc-and-size 
                       (list x (+ y controls-height) 
                             state-width state-height)))))))
\end{verbatim}
After the control button locations have been determined, the state
button locations are calculated.  Then each of the state objects is
also sent a {\tt :loc-and-size} message with the new locations.  Note
that the window also cannot be reduced to a very small height either
since the size is reset to a value that will accomodate both the
control buttons and the state buttons. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :do-click} method}
\label{subsubsec:dmc-do-click}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :do-click (x y m1 m2)
  (catch 'done
    (dolist (obj (slot-value 'button-objs))
	    (when (send obj :my-click x y m1 m2)
		  (send obj :do-click)
		  (throw 'done nil)))
    (dolist (obj (slot-value 'state-objs))
	    (when (send obj :my-click x y m1 m2)
		  (send obj :do-click self)
		  (throw 'done nil)))))
\end{verbatim}
Once the window is created, the user may click on certain buttons
installed in the window to invoke various actions.  When such a click
occurs, the code has to determine which button was the focus of the
click. This {\tt :do-click} method is invoked whenever such a click
occurs; the {\tt Lisp-stat} system provides this. It is the
responsibility of the programmer to pack into this {\tt :do-click}
method whatever needs to be done.  In our case, we have to determine
two things: was the click on a control button? or was it on on a state
button?  The code first polls the control buttons and then the state
buttons to see if any one of them owns up to the click.  If so, that
object is sent a message to perform the click-action.  If none of the
objects owns up to the click, nothing is done. Notice that if any of
the  buttons owns up to the click, none of the remaining ones are
polled. The {\tt catch} and {\tt throw} construct ensure this fact.

\subsubsection{The {\tt :no-of-states} method}
\label{subsubsec:no-of-states}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :no-of-states ()
  (length (slot-value 'state-objs)))
\end{verbatim}
This is just an accessor method that returns the number of states in
the markov chain. An accessor method for a slot is one that returns
the value stored in that particular slot. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt print-transition-matrix} method}
\label{subsubsec:print-transition-matrix}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :print-transition-matrix ()
  (print-matrix (send self :transition-matrix)))
\end{verbatim}
Using the {\tt Lisp-stat} function {\tt print-matrix}, the transition
matrix is printed in a nice form.  However, it should be remarked that
when a markov chain has a large number of states, it is hard to make
sense of this printout. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :transition-matrix} method}
\label{subsubsec:transition-matrix}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :transition-matrix ()
  (let ((n (send self :no-of-states))
        (tmp nil))
    (dolist (obj (slot-value 'state-objs))
            (setf tmp 
                  (append tmp 
                          (coerce 
                           (send obj :prob-vec) 'list))))
    (matrix (list n n) (coerce tmp 'list))))
\end{verbatim}
This method returns the transition matrix.  Recall that the transition
matrix is not stored as a matrix anywhere.  However, since each state
object has a copy of its transition probability vector, the transition
matrix can be recreated.  This method collects all such probability
vectors and builds them into a matrix.  We don't envision this method
to be used with great frequency. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :run-dmc} method}
\label{subsubsec:run-dmc}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :run-dmc (&optional k)
  (if k
      (dotimes (j k)
               (send self :goto-next-state)
               (pause *run-step-delay*))
    (send self :goto-next-state)))
\end{verbatim}
This method runs the Markov Chain $k$ steps, or if $k$ is not supplied
as an optional argument, one step.  In the latter case, the markov chain
merely goes to the next state. It uses the {\tt :goto-next-state}
method (see section~\ref{subsubsec:goto-next-state}) to accomplish the
transition.  

\subsubsection{The {\tt :run-dmc-silently} method}
\label{subsubsec:run-dmc-silently}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :run-dmc-silently (k)
  (let* ((state-objs (slot-value 'state-objs))
         (cs (slot-value 'current-state))
         (obj (select state-objs cs))
         (next-obj nil))
    (case (slot-value 'history)
         (nil (dotimes (j k)
                       (setf (slot-value 'time)
                             (+ (slot-value 'time) 1))

  (send self :redraw))
\end{verbatim}
This method runs the markov chain for $k$ steps silently.  This is
useful when the user wants to run the markov chain for a large number
of steps without watching its complete history.  If history recording
is on, then all the intermediate state visits are recorded in the
appropriate file.  Each state object dutifully increments the {\tt
  no-of-visits} slot whenever it is visited. Finally, when the loop is
over, the window is redrawn to show the new time and the new current
state. This method is truly silent in that if sample paths window is
on, it is not updated. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :goto-next-state} method}
\label{subsubsec:goto-next-state}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :goto-next-state ()
  (let* ((time (slot-value 'time))
         (state-objs (slot-value 'state-objs))
         (cs (slot-value 'current-state))
         (obj (select state-objs cs))
         (next-state (send obj :next-state))
         (next-obj (select state-objs next-state))
         (w (slot-value 'sample-paths)))
    (when w 
          (send w :add-lines 
                (list (list time 
                            (+ time 1)) (list cs next-state)))
          (if (> *time-window* 0)
              (send w :range 0 
                    (max 0 (- time *time-window* -1)) 
                    (max 50 (+ time 1)))
            (send w :adjust-to-data)))
          
    (setf (slot-value 'current-state) next-state)
    (send self :tick-time)

    (send obj :you-are-not-current-state self)
    (send next-obj :you-are-current-state self))
  (when (slot-value 'history)
        (format *history-file-handle* "~d~%" 
                (slot-value 'current-state))))
\end{verbatim}
This method sends the Markov chain to the next state.  There are a few
things that need to be done: the clock has to be incremented, the
next state has to be determined and finally the markov chain has to be
sent to the next state.  The user might have requested sample paths be
drawn, in which case the sample paths window must be updated. The
sample paths window can display a fixed time-frame at a time, or
accumulate the complete history of the process, which is the case if
the global variable {\tt *time-window*} is zero.  In the latter
situation, the user can use a scroll-bar in the bottom of the window
to view the whole history.  If {\tt *time-window} is non-zero, then
the history for the last {\tt *time-window*} units of time is
displayed. This is accomplished by adjusting the range for the
abscissa to give the appearance of new lines appearing on the right
and old ones disappearing from the left. If  history recording was
requested, the code above makes sure it records the transitions in the
specified file. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :time} method}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :time (&optional value)
  (if value
      (let ((obj (select (slot-value 'button-objs) 3)))
        (setf (slot-value 'time) 0)
        (send obj :title 
              (format nil "Time: ~d" (slot-value 'time)))
        (send obj :redraw self))
    (slot-value 'time)))
\end{verbatim}
This method retrieves the current time, or sets it if {\tt
  value} is supplied.  When time is set, it must be ensured that the
clock button in the window is displaying the correct time.  Therefore,
this method send the button a new title with the current time included
in it.

\subsubsection{The {\tt :tick-time} method}
\label{subsubsec:tick-time}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :tick-time ()
  (setf (slot-value 'time) (+ (slot-value 'time) 1))
  (let ((obj (select (slot-value 'button-objs) 3)))
    (send obj :title 
          (format nil "Time: ~d" (slot-value 'time)))
    (send obj :redraw self)))
\end{verbatim}
This method increments the time by 1. Again, it makes certain the the
new time is shown on the clock button in the window.

\subsubsection{The {\tt :current-state} method}
\label{subsubsec:current-state}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :current-state ()
  (slot-value 'current-state))
\end{verbatim}
This is just an accessor method for the slot {\tt current-state}.
The returned value is an integer between $0$ and $n-1$, where $n$ is
the number of states.

\subsubsection{The {\tt :describe} method}
\label{subsubsec:dmc-describe}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :describe ()
  (let ((time (slot-value 'time)))
    (format t "-------------------------------------------~%")
    (format t "~%State         No of visits     Proportion~%")
    (format t "-------------------------------------------~%")
    (dolist (obj (slot-value 'state-objs))
            (if (> time 0) 
                (send obj :describe time)
              (send obj :describe)))
  (format t "-------------------------------------------~%")))
\end{verbatim}
This method prints the statistics for each state in the Markov chain.
It prints how many times each state has been visited and the
proportion of visits if the time is greater than 0. To make the
summary compact, the number of visits is not printed for those states
yet unvisited. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :reset} method}
\label{subsubsec:reset}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :reset ()
  (send self :time 0)
  (dolist (obj (slot-value 'state-objs))
          (send obj :reset))
  (if (slot-value 'sample-paths)
      (send (slot-value 'sample-paths) :clear))
  (when (slot-value 'history)
        (send self :record-history nil))
  (let ((obj (send self :current-state-obj)))
    (setf (slot-value 'current-state)
          (slot-value 'initial-state))
    (send (send self :current-state-obj) 
          :you-are-current-state self)
    (send obj :you-are-not-current-state self)))
\end{verbatim}
The Markov chain is reset by this method.  Time is set to zero.  The 
statistics for each state are reset by the {\tt :reset} method for state 
items.  If the {\tt sample-paths} window is currently displayed, it is 
reset with the {\tt :clear} method.  If the {\tt history} slot is
open, it is  closed.  Otherwise it is set to {\tt nil}.
The value of the current state is returned to the value of the initial
state, which is then highlighted by {\tt :you-are-current-state}.  The
former current state is returned to its normal colors by {\tt
  :you-are-not-current-state}. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :redraw} method}
\label{subsubsec:dmc-redraw}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :redraw ()
  (dolist (obj (slot-value 'button-objs))
          (send obj :redraw self))
  (dolist (obj (slot-value 'state-objs))
            (send obj :redraw self)))
\end{verbatim}
Whenever a window is covered and uncovered, the window is sent a {\tt
  :redraw} message, which is responsible for ensuring the the window
is redrawn correctly.  If no such method is defined, then the window
contents will not be current.  The {\tt :redraw} method defined above
send each control button object and each state object
the {\tt :redraw} method along with a pointer to the window
itself.  Those methods, which are described later, redraw themselves
appropriately in the window. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :add-some-menu-items} method}
\label{subsubsec:add-some-menu-items}
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

This method adds some items to the window menu.  Those items include
the following:
\begin{description}
\item[Run Quietly] This item allows the user to invoke the {\tt
    :run-dmc-silently} method silently using the mouse. The user is
  queried for the number of steps in a pop-up dialog box. A default of
  1 step is supplied. 
\item[Sample Paths]  This item enables and disables sample paths
  window. If enabled, a line plot of the sample paths is displayed
  against time. 
\item[Describe]  This item enables the user to get a summary of the
  number of visits to each state in xlispstat command window.
\item[Normal State Color] This item enables the user to change the
  normal state color to suit his/her preference.
\item[Current State Color]  This item enables the user to change the
  current state color to suit his/her preference.
\item[State Text Color]  This item enables the user to change the
  color of the text in the normal state buttons.
\item[Current State Text Color]  This item enables the user to change
  the text in current state button.
\end{description}
The color changing items are separated from the other items by a
dashed line and all these items are installed in the menu.

\subsubsection{The {\tt :history} method}
\label{subsubsec:history}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :history (&optional val)
  (if val 
      (setf (slot-value 'history) val)
    (slot-value 'history)))
\end{verbatim}
This method sets and retrieves the value in the history slot. The
value is set if {\tt val}, which should be boolean, is supplied.

\subsubsection{The {\tt :record-history} method}
\label{subsubsec:record-history}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :record-history (on)
  (let ((hist-item 
         (select (send (send self :menu) :items) 2)))
    (case on
          (nil (setf (slot-value 'history) nil)
               (format *history-file-handle*
                       "End Time: ~d~%" (slot-value 'time))
               (close *history-file-handle*)
               (send hist-item :mark nil))
          (t (let ((fname (get-string-dialog 
                           "Name of output file: " 
                           :initial *history-file*)))
               (when fname
                     (setf (slot-value 'history) t)
                     (setf *history-file-handle* 
                           (open fname :direction :output))
                     (format *history-file-handle* 
                             "Start Time: ~d~%" 
                             (slot-value 'time))
                     (send hist-item :mark t)))))))
\end{verbatim}
This method disables or enables the recording of history. When it is
enabled, the user is prompted for a file name into which the state
visits can be recorded. A default name of ``history.mc'' is provided.
When the file is opened for output, the current time is recorded and
the history item in the menu is marked with a check mark.  When the
history recording is disabled, the check mark is removed and the
output file is closed. The ending time is also recorded. 

\subsubsection{The {\tt :sample-paths} method}
\label{subsubsec:sample-paths}
\begin{verbatim}
(defmeth dmc-proto :sample-paths (on)
  (let ((menu-item (select (send (send self :menu) :items) 1))
        (boss self))
    (case on
          (nil (send (slot-value 'sample-paths) :close))
          (t (let ((w (plot-lines 
                       (list (slot-value 'time))
                       (list (slot-value 'current-state))))
                   (y-lim 
                    (select (get-nice-range 
                             0 (send self :no-of-states) 
                             5) 1)))
               (send w :range 1 0 y-lim)
               (send w :title 
                     (concatenate 'string 
                                  (send boss :title)
                                  ": Sample Paths"))
               (if (eql *time-window* 0)
                   (send w :has-h-scroll 1000)
                 (send w :range 0 0 *time-window*))
               (send menu-item :mark t)
               (setf (slot-value 'sample-paths) w)
               (defmeth w :close ()
                 (send menu-item :mark nil)
                 (send boss :slot-value 'sample-paths nil)
                 (send self :remove)))))))
\end{verbatim}
This method turns the display of the sample paths on or off. When the
display is enabled, the sample paths window is given a title which if
formed by concatenating the title of the {\tt dmc-proto} instance with
the string ``: Sample Paths''. The $x$ and $y$ range are adjusted so
that the sample paths window need not be resized all the time. The
menu item is marked with a check and the identity of the sample paths
window is recorded in the slot {\tt sample-paths}. The sample paths
window's {\tt :close} method is redefined so that when it is closed
with a mouse, the check against the menu item is removed and the
slot value {\tt sample-paths} is also set back to {\tt nil}. This
ensures a sane exit. When sample paths is disabled, then all we need
to do is to send the sample paths window a {\tt :close} message.  

\subsubsection{The {\tt :set-color} methods}
\label{subsubsec:set-color}
We shall not discuss the color methods because they are not fully
implemented. It is hoped at some future date that users will be able
to set the color interactively using a package like the first author's
{\tt color.lsp}.
