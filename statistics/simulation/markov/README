The documentation for the software is in the files doc/paper.tex and 
doc/paper.ps.  Paper.ps includes a postscript figure that may tax
or even confuse your printer. The problem, I think, is the 
color window dump which seems to bomb on some of our printers
too, especially the ones doing ps emulation.

If you wish to LaTeX paper.tex, you'd need dvips as well as
Timothy Van Zandt's PSTricks.  These are available from
labrea.stanford.edu and princeton.edu respectively for
anonymous ftp.

If you do not wish to read the documentation currently and wish
to jump right into it (after unpacking), the files gambler.lsp
and thm.lsp are the ones to load in Xlisp-Stat.

If you find any bugs or problems, I'd appreciate hearing
about it.  I have tested the software on a Mac as well as a
Unix workstation. I have not had the chance to test it on
a PC, so I'd appreciate hearing about that.
