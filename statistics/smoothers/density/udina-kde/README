File README, kde directory
May 15, 1995

This directory,
        ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/kde 
contains lisp code to be run under XLISP-STAT. The whole is under
development forever, so, use it at your own risk and fun.

KDE means Kernel Density Estimation, these files create xlisp-stat
objects to display interactively such estimations. Only univariate 
density estimation is currently supported.

File FILES contains a brief description of the files in this
directory.

For trying it, start xlisp-stat with some memory available from a
directory containing these files, and type
(load "buf-snow.kde")
or
(load "Stamps.kde")
or any other example file. Then, explore the KDE menu.

To start a kde object for your own data, load runkde.lsp 
and try one of
(make-kde :data your-data-in-a-lisp-list)
or
(make-kde-from-file "filename")

See below for more detailed technical info.

You can use it all freely. If you use it, please notify the author and
adjoin any useful comments you have. You can also distribute the code.
If you modify it in any essential way, please notify it to the author,
and clarify what part of the code is yours and the credits for the rest.

===================================================================

If you have problems running the software, please read these notes. If
your problems doesn't disappear, send me e-mail with some details
about the version and OS of your XLisp-Stat copy.


YOU NEED XLISP-STAT RUNNING FIRST
Xlisp-Stat is a free lisp dialect specialized for statistical
computing. You can get more info about it, and get the software too,
by ftp'ing to umnstat.stat.umn.edu.

KDE FILES MUST LIVE ALL TOGETHER IN THE SAME DIRECTORY
Put them all in a new directory or in the XLisp-Stat directory. If you
put the files in a directory, be sure that XLisp-Stat can access them
for loading. In the Mac or in MS-Windows, this is easy: use the
'Load file' item in the File menu. In Unix, start XLisp-Stat from the
directory where the files lie, or type
(set-working-directory "the-dir-where-you-put-it")
once in the lisp prompt.

HOW MUCH MEMORY?
I use to work with 250,000 nodes in the lisp workspace in my Unix box
and about 150000 in the Mac PowerBook. Probably this is too much, but is
useful while developing. Ask for it with the `(room)' call.
Try experimenting with `(expand nnn)' to tune up it.

FILES WITH EXTENSION .KDE
contain XLisp-Stat calls to create a full KDE object for some data
set. Loading one of this file will create the object and display his
contents in a window. You can be interested in reading those files and
modify it to suit your particular needs.

ONCE IN XLISP-STAT,
you need to load the files for using it. This is done automatically by
the .kde files. To load the files, simply type
(load "runkde")
and wait some moments for the loading be complete.

IF YOU HAVE YOUR DATA IN A TEXT FILE,
you can load it in a kde object easily. Enter XLisp-Stat and type:
(make-kde-from-file "filename.xxx")
This will read your data for the file, provided they are separated by
spaces or newline characters.

IF YOU KNOW LISP
enough to have your data loaded in the lisp workspace as a lisp list,
then you can type
(make-kde :data my-list-of-data)

COMPILED LISP CODE
runs faster than pure interpreted code. Files with .fsl extension are
the compiled version of the matching .lsp files. XLisp-Stat load the
newest of the two files (file.lsp or file.fsl). If you want to
recompile the files in your own environment, remove all the .fsl files 
and type
(load "compile-kde-files")
when in the lisp prompt. Compilation is slow, go for a coffee.
XLisp-Stat will load the newer of the files .lsp and .fsl, you can
keep only one of them in your directory if space is a big concern.

IF YOU NEED MORE INFO, look for it:

KDE files can be found in
     ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/kde

The file
     ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/kde/FILES
describes the contents of that directory.

A file notesAboutKDE.ps contain a possibly not updated version of a
paper that describes KDE objects, how to use it, and some theoretical
background to use it properly. It is on:
     ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/papers/notesAboutKDE.ps.Z

There is another draft describing the transformations stuff that is
used for the local bandwidth controller. It is on:
     ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/transfor/transformations.ps.gz

The gnuplot bridge is described in
     ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/papers/HQGinLISP-STAT.ps[.gz]

If you don't have any of these files, try ftp'ing:

ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/kde

ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/papers/HQGinLISP-STAT.ps[.gz]
 
ftp://halley.upf.es:/stat/transfor/transformations.ps.gz
