README        is a file to be read, surprised?

kde.shar      is a shar file. To unshar it, type `sh kde.shar' in your
              /bin/sh shell once in an appropriate directory.

kde.shar.gz   is a compressed version of it, use gunzip from GNU to
              uncompress it.

kde.sit.hqx   is a bin-hex'ed and stuffit version of kde.shar for Mac
              users.

lisp-sources  directory contain individual copies of all the lisp
              files as described below.

compiled-files directory contain individual files in compiled version.


===================================================================

                Needed files to run kde objects

(you need either the .lsp or the compiled .fsl, not both)



runkde.lsp    is the normal way to access kde objects,
	      it has only some function for creating kde objects
	      it loads all the files needed.

kde.lsp       is the core file

kde_conf.lsp  Global var definitions and some utility functions.

calckde.lsp   Numerical routines for computing kernel estimates

binning.lsp   Routines for binning data.

wkde.lsp      Code for the wkde-proto object, 
              the window that displays kde objects
	      it is needed if you want to see the graphical aspect of kde
	      objects, but kde objects can run without windows. 

kdehisto.lsp  kde-proto methods to deal with histograms and related things.

transfor.lsp  contains code for transf-proto object.

funnorms.lsp  some utilities for computing numerical approx to integrals 
              and functional norms.

plotline.lsp  some modification of the xlispstat function plot-lines.

goldsear.lsp  in the Macintosh and some unix versions, 
              the function golden-search is documented but not defined.
              Here is a slow lisp version of it.

distrobj.lsp  contains code for distrobj-proto, a primitive distribution object
	      prototype that allows easy building of mixtures.

gnuplot.lsp   Interface to gnuplot for high-quality output. Written with
              Jan De Leeuw. 

getfile.lsp   file-selector-dialog, from Bernhard Walter.
              

Other files containing some kde objects with real data sets, some of them 
quite popular:

buf-snow.kde
chrondite.lsp
income75.lsp
notes.kde
old-faithful.kde
Stamps.kde
Log-Suicide.kde
