Below is some xlispstat code for doing mvkde's ala Wand.  I've generalized it
to n-dimensions, rather than the 2 or 3 dimensions of Wand.  It also uses a
single routine for all dimensions as opposed to his separate routines for each
dimension.

There are some useful parts to this code.  To get this working I had to:

  1.  Write a macro for iterating over arrays.
  2.  Write an n-dimensional outer product.
  3.  Write an n-dimensional FFT.

and of course generalize Wand's routines.

This code has only been tested in a very simple 2-dimensional case.  Would
anyone on your end be interested in testing it further?  I am a bit weary of
looking at it right now, and would like to turn my attention to something
else.
