These are a few routines that will allow you to do kernel density
estimation.  I know that Tierney has these very same capabilities
available, but this version will be developed further when I get
time.  This one allows you to use  weights. I use it as a base for my
importance sampling routines that I shall post later. .

Besides, there is also an example of how to use "call-lfun",
as well as an overlay package that can be used for many purposes.


Feel free send me any bug reports or comments.
