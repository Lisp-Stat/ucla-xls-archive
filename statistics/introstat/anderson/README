I would like to contribute some introductory statistics modules to the
archive.  They relate to three activities in the Activity-Based Statistics
material of Scheaffer et al.  

Three modules have been created to display a capture/recapture experiment,
a randomized response survey, and a demonstration of confidence intervals.
All of the modules are pretty crude at the moment, but people should be
able to get the idea, and I (or someone else) may be willing to make these
modules more elegant in the future.


I can send them to you by email or you can access the *.lsp files at

URL http://cda/mrs.umn.edu/~anderson/modules/confint.lsp 
URL http://cda/mrs.umn.edu/~anderson/modules/randresp.lsp
URL http://cda/mrs.umn.edu/~anderson/modules/recapt.lsp


Let me know if you don't think they are ready to be posted, or if you have
trouble accessing them.
