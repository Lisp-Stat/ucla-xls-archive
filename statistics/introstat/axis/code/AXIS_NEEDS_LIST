AXIS NEEDS LIST..... with posted date

   2 Feb 94 ... Add subset analysis.

  30 Jan 94 ... Add smoother transformation as a function to make a variable,
                as in log transformation.  Some sort of transformation 
                guide in the documentation. lowess exists...

  23 Jan 94 ... Adopt the principle that all internal items are kept
                as symbols wherever possible.

   6 Jan 94 ... Add principal components.

   6 Jan 94 ... Add ridge regression with ridge trace plot as a slider.

   9 Jan 94 ... Add ability to export from the current frame to global scope.

   6 Jan 94 ... Add interface for logistic regression and Tierney GLIM code.

   6 Jan 94 ... Add generalized additive models.
   
   6 Jan 94 ... Add automatic conversion of symbol collections to
                dummy variables.  Something like the S model.

  30 Jun 93 ... Protocol for handling closing of window and activating
                another if available. FIND the BUG that kills AXIS.
                Happens around density plots, closing datasets.

  29 Jun 93 ... Better error processing (eg- 3 vars for spin plot)

  29 Jun 93 ... Icon jump when clicked.

  26 Jun 93 ... How to manipulate bootstrap data, as in ratio of two
                regression coefficients.

  26 Jun 93 ... Data viewer, spreadsheet editor.

  26 Jun 93 ... Missing data handling with listwise deletion given the
                current recursive evaluator method.  (Dont see the missing
                until the end...)   Improved filtering, as in partial
                regression plots.

Completed Tasks.....

    Done          Item and closure... (posted date)
  ----------    --------------------------------------

  10 Feb 94 ... Add spinner to regression model with 2 covariates.

   7 Feb 94 ... Add correlation window with more than two variables.
                Use the built-in covariance-matrix func. Revised corr code 
                and calling dialog in axis.  30 Apr 93.

   5 Feb 94 ... Replace send-it by some sort of message/more button.   
                Add send-it/messenger to scatterplot menu item. Messenger
                class created.  Available from plot menu. 2 Feb 94

   2 Feb 94 ... BUG in parsing transformation from covariates in regr.
                Now use two types of form items in the command dialogs.
                List form items parse multiple, others dont.  Also killed
                the bug that the dependent var was not correctly labelled
                when it had been transformed. 2 Feb 94

  23 Jan 94 ... Interactions of plots feeding back to dataset, such
                as exporting filters requires global and does not feed
                back to the filter icon for rendering... Globals
                remain unavoidable, but at least with some fixing the
                feature icons can look at the dataset.  23 Jan 94.

  23 Jan 94 ... Add a unified transformation slider to the univariate
                display option... Kluged from the density plot rather than
                from an item list.  NEED systematic way to handle multiple
                linked plots.  3 Jan 94.

  15 Jan 94 ... Bug in the sequence plot feature...Double () in     
                variable-icon-proto :BUILD-MENU function. 6 Jan 94.

  15 Jan 94 ... Add symmetry plot... Added as option (ala QQ) with density
                plot.  Labelled plots modified with this change and 
                menu item renamed "univariate". 6 Jan 94.

   9 Jan 94 ... Saving standardized, studentized residuals, resids, leverage,
                influence fit as a list that can be augmented by other 
                decendant routines, like robust regression...
                Added to commando code to read aList and save data. 6 Jan 94
          
   8 Jan 94 ... Anova table and p-values for regression in output...
                Anova added to patch file, Pvals in axisRegr. 6 Jan 94.

  30 Apr 93 ... Data directory default.

  29 Jun 93 ... Data filter operation as axis had to allow subsetting on
                some type of criterion. 30 Apr 93

  26 Jun 93 ... Open file dialog using operating system/Lisp rather
                than a text file listing.  30 Apr 93

  26 Jun 93 ... Redesign menu to add browse and send buttons, as well
                as something to add in more of the box-cox and other "old"
                features.  30 Apr 93 ... sendit evaluation.
