Hi Jan,

Seems that we are doing much the same thing.  I have an interface
designed to protect students in intro courses from Lisp (mostly)
as well as add some useful methods for regression diagnostics and
bootstrap resampling.

The files are available anynymous ftp from

 	hilbert.wharton.upenn.edu

within the pub/xlispstat/AXIS subdirectory.  The application
is quite similar to yours, only it builds three menu items
which are used to load data, open statistics dialogs, and
manipulate variable icons.

Alas, it is in much the same state as yours with almost 
daily changes.

Bob
