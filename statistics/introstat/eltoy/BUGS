BUGS

There is no clean way to get rid of a clt plot.  If you press
the close button, the plot goes away, but there is no easy way to get
it back.

There is currently no "help" button.

The behavior when you select an item from one of the main menus a
second time is inconsistent.  In particular, the behavior of the CLT
ToY and ElToY menus should mimic DIST-TOY.  As a side effect, it is
difficult to restart a ElToY or CLT ToY.

The throw to 'ElToY-return on exit from an ElToY doesn't seem to work
right.  

The "Close" button should cleanly close all related windows instead of
just the one window.  It should also reset the state of the
corresponding menu.

FEATURES

Xlispstat has a very stupid algorithm for placing windows.  They
usually wind up on top of each other.

Xlispstat doesn't update the parameters immediately if you edit the
text items on the sliders.  Press the corresponding "update" button to
register the change.

Xlispstat doesn't update the scale of the graph when the contents
change.  You must select "Rescale Plot" from the graph's menu.
