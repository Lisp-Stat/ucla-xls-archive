Show data is a simple Xlisp-Stat tool to allow users unfamiliar with 
the language to construct plots from their pre-defined variables.  The
interface is graphical and allows a user to select the type of plot
as well as which variables are to be plotted.  The program supports the
following types of plots:

1) Scatterplots
2) Scatterplot Matricies
3) Line/Time Plots
4) Boxplots
5) Histograms
6) Spin Plots
7) Quantile Plots
8) Dot Plots
9) Stem and Leaf Plots

The 2 keywords 
(a) :varnames 
(b) :case-labels 
are optional and should be lists of strings of length:
(a) the number of variables submitted to the program, and
(b) the number of cases for each variable

    Variables do not have to be of the same length, but some plots will not
accept variables of different lengths (eg. Scatterplot Matricies).  The name
of each plot is printed in the listener window if the user wishes to send 
messages to the plots.
Calls to the program should be of the form:
(show-data (list var1 var2 ... varn)
           :varnames (list "Var1" "Var2" ... "Varn")
           :case-labels (list "Obs1" "Obs2" ... "Obsk"))
