The problem we study in this note is to maximize a function of the form
$$\cL(\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^n\log\pi_i(\beta),$$
where
$$\pi_i(\beta)=\Phi(x_i'\beta)-\Phi(z_i'\beta).$$
Here $\Phi(\bullet)$ is a given cdf, and the $x_i$ and $z_i$ are known
vectors of numbers. The elements of $\beta$ are the unknown parameters
that we have to estimate. Of course we have to restrict the $\beta$ by requiring
$$(x_i-z_i)'\beta\geq 0$$
for all $i,$ but as long as these inequalities are indeed
solvable, it is clear that the fact that we are maximizing will keep
us away from the boundary, and will keep us feasible.

Let us look at the derivatives. We find
$${{\partial\cL}\over{\partial\beta}}=
\sum_{i=1}^n{{1}\over{\pi_i}}
\{\phi(x_i'\beta)x_i-\phi(z_i'\beta)z_i\}.$$
Also
$$\eqalign{
{{\partial^2\cL}\over{\partial\beta^2}}&=
\sum_{i=1}^n{{1}\over{\pi_i}}
\{\phi'(x_i'\beta)x_ix_i'-\phi'(z_i'\beta)z_iz_i'\}\cr
&-\sum_{i=1}^n{{1}\over{\pi_i^2}}
\{\phi(x_i'\beta)x_i-\phi(z_i'\beta)z_i\}
\{\phi(x_i'\beta)x_i-\phi(z_i'\beta)z_i\}'.}$$
