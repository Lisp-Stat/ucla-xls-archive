On the Cost of Data Analysis - Paper and lisp source code
=========================================================

			ABSTRACT
			========

A regression analysis usually consists of several stages such as
variable selection, transformation and residual diagnosis. Inference
is often made from the selected model without regard to the model
selection methods that proceeded it. This can result in overoptimistic
and biased inferences.  We first characterize data analytic actions as
functions acting on regression models.  We investigate the extent of
the problem and test bootstrap, jacknife and sample splitting methods
for ameliorating it. We also demonstrate an interactive LISP-STAT
system for assessing the cost of the data analysis while it is taking
place.
			FILES
			=====

rat.lsp is the lisp code for parallel boostrap/jacknife regression
method discussed in the paper.

simul.lsp is the lisp code for the simulations described
in the paper

chicago.lsp is the data for the example in the paper.

regmodel.lsp contains the additional methods (eda for regression)

auxil.lsp contains some auxiliary functions

			XLISP-STAT
			==========

You will need XLISPSTAT to run these programs. Here is an excerpt from
the documentation for  XLISPSTAT:

This note is to announce the availability of Version 2.1 of
XLISP-STAT, an extensible system for statistical computing and dynamic
graphics.

XLISP-STAT is based on a dialect of Lisp called XLISP. It is available
for the Apple Macintosh, for workstations running the X11 window
system under BSD UNIX (and perhaps System V with BSD enhancements),
and for Sun workstations running SunView. A version for the Commodore
Amiga is available as well.

The system is based on David Betz' XLISP 2.1, which is written in C.
To facilitate statistical computations I have modified standard Lisp
functions for addition, logarithms, etc., to operate on lists and
arrays of numbers, and have also added a number of basic statistical
functions. About two thirds of the additions are written in C; the
rest are written in Lisp. Several basic forms of plots, including
histograms, scatterplots, 3-dimensional rotatable plots and
scatterplot matrices are provided.  These plots support various forms
of interactive highlighting operations and can be linked so points
highlighted in one plot will be highlighted in all linked plots.
Interactions with the plots are controlled by the mouse, menus and
dialog boxes. An object-oriented programming system is used to make it
possible to customize menus, dialogs, and the way plots respond to
mouse actions.

Source code for the UNIX version, which can be compiled without
graphics, for X11 graphics, or for SunView graphics, is available by
anonymous ftp from

	umnstat.stat.umn.edu (128.101.51.1)

It is in the file xlispstat2.1R1.tar.Z in the directory pub/xlispstat.
(The version and release numbers will be updated as changes are
made/bugs are fixed).  This system has been compiled on a VAX, DEC
3100 (pmax), Sun 3, Encore Multimax and (with a modified Makefile) a
Cray XMP.

The Macintosh version is also available by anonymous ftp from the
address given above. The Macintosh distribution consists of two parts,
contained in the files

	XLISP-STAT2.1R1.Disk1.sit.Hqx
	XLISP-STAT2.1R1.Disk2.sit.Hqx

in the directory pub/xlispstat. These files contain archives created
with StuffIt 1.5.1 that have been binhexed with BinHex 4.0. The
Macintosh distribution includes two versions of the system, one for
macs with a math coprocessor and one for generic macs. Source code for
the Macintosh version is included in the UNIX sources.

For reasonable operation the Mac version requires 2MB of memory. It
may be possible to use it on very small problems with only 1MB. The
program is fairly slow on a Mac Plus or SE.

A tutorial introduction to the system is available. It is written
primarily for the Macintosh version, but the differences to the UNIX
version are minor. The tutorial is available as a set of LaTeX files
in xlispstat.doc.tar.Z in the directory pub/xlispstat at the ftp
address above.

If you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can obtain the source
code and documentation from the statlib archive. To find out how to do
this, send a mail message to

	statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu

containing the line

	send index from xlispstat

More complete documentation will be published as a book that should be
available from Wiley in October 1990. The title of the book is
"Lisp-Stat: An object-oriented environment for statistical computing
and dynamic graphics."

;; At this point a dialog box asks the user to choose between
;; a bootstrap or jacknife analysis of the data. 
;;
;; Another dialog box now asks for the number of resamples.
;; The default number is 50.
;;
;; The user is now prompted to select which predictors are of
;; specific interest in the analysis. Resampling distributions
;; of the estimates of selected parameters can be provided and 
;; variable selection will not eliminate the selected variables.
;; All, some or none of the variables may be selected.
;;
;; The user is now prompted to enter the point(s) at which predictions
;; are to be made. Hit cancel if not required.
;;
;; If any variables had been selected earlier for resampling distributions
;; of the parameter effects, the user will be prompted to select the
;; point at which the parameters should be interpreted. (see the paper
;; for further details)
;;
;; At this point, a menu bar will appear entitled "RAT", but no
;; selection can be made until all the resampled regression models
;; have been constructed. When the break prompt appears you can make
;; a selection from the menu. The output will thus will look like this:

Bootstrap method
No. of resamples= 50
break: **BREAK**
if continued: return from BREAK
1> 

;; Clicking on the "RAT" menu provides several alternatives
;; "Display model" prints out the currently fitted model for the original 
;;                 data.
;; "History" prints out an audit of the current regression analysis
;; "Summary" prints out some numerical summaries for the quantities
;;           of interest using the resampled models
;; "Effect density" will display a kernel density estimate of the 
;;                  effect of interest. The user will be prompted if
;;                  more than one effect is of interest. The bandwidth of
;;                  the estimate may be changed from the menu. The estimated
;;                  effect from the original data is displayed as a point
;;                  on the x-axis.
;; "Prediction density" same as above but for the predictions of interest.
;; "Effect history" displays the changing distribution of the estimated
;;                  distribution of the effects over the history of
;;                  the analysis. Data may be displayed in boxplots or
;; 		    in a 3-D succession of density estimates called a
;;                  density slice. The estimated effects from the original data 
;;                  is displayed as points on the boxplots and as a line under
;;                  the surface in the density slices. There will be a 
;;                  distribution for each action plus one for the initial state.
;;                  Refer to "History" to identify each.
;; "Prediction history" same as above but for the predictions of interest.
;; "Effect slice" displays the distribution of an effect across a range
;;                an interpretation points. The user is prompted for two
;;                points in the prediction space and the number of distributions
;;                to be calculated equally spaced between these two points.
;; "Prediction slice" same as above but for the predictions of interest.
;; "Continue" brings up a menu to select the next data analytic action
;; "Remove menu" removes the menu - don't do this unless you are finished.
;;
;; It is also possible to enter written commands at the prompt. The model
;; for the original data is called "nr" and the list of resampled models is
;; called "nrl" so for example
;;                 (send nr :display)
;; has the same effect as "Display" above and
;;                 (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (caar (send x :tran-list))) nrl)
;; will display a list of the transforms on the response in the resampled models.
;; Other quantities of interest are stored in the object "rat-info".
;; See rat.lsp for details.

;; SIMULATION CODE
;;
;; The calling sequences for the models described in the paper are
;; given in simul.lsp. Other models may be chosen by varying the
;; calling sequence or changing the function generate-data.
