(defun monor (x)
"ARGS: x
This takes a list of three sequences of equal length. It then
computes the monotone regression on the first sequence, using
weights in the second sequence. The third sequence in the list X
is a work array indicating size of the blocks in the monotone
regression. In the call this is usually just a vector of ones,
but it changes in the recursive calls to the function."
