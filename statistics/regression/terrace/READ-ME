Welcome to TERRACE-TWO by James Hilden-Minton.

TERRACE-TWO is an interact package in xlisp-stat for estimating
and diagnosing two-level linear models. 

For code, see                                     ter2.lsp
For explication of code (~60 pages), see          ter2.ps
For examples with growth curve data, load         box.lsp box.data
                                                  rat.lsp rat.data
For example with aerosol data, load               aerosol.lsp

David Afshartous is writting a friendly user's guide. For
now try loading  box.lsp  in xlisp-stat. A dialog box should
pop up and lead you through many interactive model specification
procedures. Graphical interface works in x-windows, and 
portability is yet unknown.

Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions or find 
any bugs. This project is still in the early stages of development.
