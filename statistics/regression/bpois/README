General Remarks and Steps for installation.               94/07/29
___________________________________________

This file contains some general remarks and steps for installation.
In addition, there is a brief description of the contents at the
end. 

This code has been tested on Suns and SGI workstations and should work
exactly as described in the Tech Report. If it doesn't, I want
to know about it, so please COMPLAIN.  Next, the code works
best on the new xlispstat. The unfortunate thing is that the
new beta release needs a few fixes before you can do that. You
should probably not bother Tierney---he knows about it and has 
fixed them all. However, he will most likely make the fixes 
available only in the next beta release.

I have included instructions here for the old release. When a new
beta is released, I will be posting an update and announcing it
to everybody on the xlispstat mailing list.  Actually, the code will
remain the same, only the installation process will be a little 
different since some new header files for the kde package will be
needed and the dynamic loading will be a little different.

YOU MUST HAVE DYNAMIC LOADING ENABLED FOR THESE PROGRAMS TO WORK.

The following instructions suppose that % is your Unix prompt. 

1. Type make:

	% make

This should create some .o files for you.

2. Decide how big a data set you wish to use. We would suggest 
   beginning with a modest sample size of 50 and increasing it
   as you see fit. (The speed of the dynamic graphics depends on
   your machine.) So type,

   % chop_ship 50
 
   If you want to get the exact same results as those shown in the 
   technical report, you'll have to type 

   % chop_ship 500

3. Either follow the instructions in the tech report for the 
   user-friendly interface, or for a quick(er) launch, type 

   % xlispstat ship 

4. If you want to duplicate our results on the Pump Data exactly, type

   % chop_pump 500 
   % xlispstat pump
   
   Otherwise, we suggest you use a smaller sample size.

Enjoy!
