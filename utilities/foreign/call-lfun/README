The following are some very simple C functions I wrote about a year ago
trying to discover how to use "call-lfun".  I had the C code lying
around and I'd completely forgotten what they did. In trying to
rediscover things for something I needed, I thought it might be 
useful to write up some commentary as well.  Of course, all this
is based on contributions from Tierney, Prothero, and Almy.

I make no claims to the correctness or appropriateness of these
code fragments, so don't blame me.  But do let me know of any
howlers.

It would be nice to write all of this in CWEB.....

CAUTION: Some of the interfaces could change in future releases.
        But don't we all love experimenting with nonstandard stuff....
