; ----   Record the calls to given functions   ----
#| 2/17/89 - try to avoid advice, not so much because it's not commonlisp
  as because it's not compiled!  In fact, I want to be able to turn on and
  off recording at high frequency and encapsulations seem to get in the way
  of this.  For now I'll assume that one does not encapsulate and record the
  same functions.

  In order to monitor a function one first prepares it for monitoring, then
  one can turn monitoring on and off at high frequency.  One can also reset
  or read the monitoring data for a function.  Finally one can forget about
  monitoring a function.

  *monitored-fns* is a list of functions currently prepared for monitoring.
  (prepare-record-calls '(f1 f2 f3)) prepares the functions named.
    additional keyword arguments: entryforms, exitforms, test
    The entryforms are evaluated at function entry, the exitforms at function
    exit.  The results are recorded along with inputs, outputs, entry time
    and exit time.  Test is a form (default is T) that determines whether
    this particular call will be recorded.  It runs in an environment where
    ARGS is bound to the argument list of the function.
  (record-on '(f1 f2 f3)) turns on recording for these functions.
  (record-off '(f1 f2 f3)) turns it off.
  (initialize-records '(f1 f2 f3)) discards all monitoring data for the
    functions (but does not turn recording off or on and does not forget
    preparation).
  (recorded-calls 'f1) returns a list of the call records for f1.
    This is a list of records of the form
    (inputs outputs start-time1 start-time2 end-time1 end-time2
	<values of entry forms> <values of exit forms>)
    Times are represented as 2 numbers since some clocks wrap around.
    The second is a wrap around count that is incremented whenever the
    finish time comes out lower than the start time.
  (summarize-calls '(f1 f2 f3)) prints a summary of the calls.
    The argument defaults to *monitored-fns*.
    Additional optional argument: name-alist
    Name-alist is something like ((f1 . "updating database") (f2 . "waiting"))
    and is used to translate function names into something more meaningful.
  (forget-record-calls '(f1 f2 f3)) discards all monitoring data and preparation

  (longest-n-calls 'f2 3) lists the 3 longest recorded calls of f2
   additional keyword arguments: start end filterfn
   filterfn - a function of 1 arg (inputs outputs start finish)
    should return T if the call is "interesting"
   start/end are special cases - filter out anything that starts before start
    or ends after end

  (time-line '(f1 f2 f3) produces a time line of activity
   additional keyword arguments: (width 80) filterfn start end name-alist

  Both symbolics and TI have a fast short clock and a slow long one.
  We use the fast one on symbolics, slow one on TI.
                    time before wrap around / #usec to read clock
                    --------------------------------------------
                    symbolics 3600           TI explorer II
             fast   >.5 hour / 67   *        16 sec. / 260
             slow   >100 yrs / 218           >1 hour / 260   *

  Actually we notice wrap around and record it - whenever a clock access
  returns a smaller value than the previous one we increment a counter.
  Therefore all events are ordered correctly, but if you fail to read the
  clock for an hour or so, it's as if that time never passed.  This is bad
  if you time things on such a coarse scale, but good if you time one thing
  for a minute today and something else for a minute tomorrow - the time
  line between such events never separates them by much more than an hour.
  In practice I don't think this will matter much.

  Since calls are recorded by pushing onto a list at exit, they are ordered
  by decreasing exit time.  This is handy for finding the outermost calls
  in the case where the calls all come from the same process (and must thus
  be properly nested).
  (outermost (recorded-calls 'foo))
  returns the subset of the calls to foo that are outermost.
