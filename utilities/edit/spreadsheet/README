This file contains a small spreadsheet editor in Xlisp-Stat, with
an example (the iris data, obviously).

This is part of our introductory statistics project, an earlier
version was integrated with the ucladata project.

One nasty problem I had was that the list-item-proto is fairly
limited. I wanted a spreadsheet with variable labels in the
first row and case labels in the first column. But scrolling
horizontally should not scroll case labels out of sight, and scrolling
vertically should not scroll variable labels out of sight. 
This editor is the current solution.

To start it, simply load "iris.lsp". This will load "spreadsheet.lsp"
and it will create an instance of the multi-variable-proto filled
with iris data and labels. This instance is called "iris". Then say
(send iris :edit), and take it from there.

There are two variations. We can say
(send iris :edit '(0 1))
which will only load the first two variables into the editor. Or
(send iris :edit '(0 1) t)
which create the editor as a modal dialog (default is modeless).

You edit a cell by double clicking, you can scroll through the 
variables by the scroll bar at the bottom, you can transform a
variable by double clicking its name. This all feels fairly
natural to me. You can revert a variable by the revert button
(this only reverts the currently active -- i.e. visible --
variable).

I have made sure that this looks good on both X11 and Mac, I
dont know about MSW. Also, it can be byte-compiled on both
types of machines. 

Weights and labels cannot be reverted. It needs a save method.
It is easy to extend it with a menu that has save, revert,
plot, and univariate statistics.
