I was visiting the archive, and noticed a couple of my files in
the contrib directory. To save you some effort in cataloging
them:


<http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat/code/incoming/majewski.lsp>

Is C code, not .lsp - and is the code to implement Common Lisp
'directory' listing function. ( It's been well used on Mac -- but
I haven't tried to use it to cross volumes, and I've seen some
other unix-to-mac ported code that has problems with that case.
It's not been tested on other platforms, but it's using the posix-y
directory function on the Mac port (that is used internally in
xlisp-stat), so it should be portable. )

I would *really* like to see this function merger into the xlisp
source distribution ( and next set of binaries )!  It's really
essential if you want to do any batch operations, like analyze
all of the data files in a particular directory. ( It may only
have managed to escape for so long because unix users can always
us the system call to 'ls' )


<http://www.stat.ucla.edu/archive/xlispstat/code/incoming/majowski.lsp>

Is Lisp code that tried to manage sets of directories from a menu,
however, the Mac open-file-dialog code uses it's own marker for the
last visited directory, and doesn't use the current-working-directory
set or retrieved by the lisp working-directory functions.

 I asked about this on the mailing list, and got that answer, but I
haven't had time to search for a solution. I don't know if it works
on non mac platforms. If it doesn't, I would suggest you just toss
that file until I can figure out a better method. If it does work on
non Mac platforms, I can't support it, as I'm currently working only
on Mac version. ( I've been passing my code to some other folks in
the dept. using MS-Win and Linux, so this may change in the future. )

 I'm currently refactoring and further documenting my framework
classes for my X-ray Energy Spectroscopy application. I'll be
sending out more info on this Real Soon, but briefly, there
are three sets or suites of modules:

 * data classes and functions:
    Functions to extend COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ's into more "first class"
    lisp sequences, so that you can use them in place of vectors
    or lists.
   DATA-SEQ-PROTO -- a pretty basic COMPOUND-DATA-SEQ
   XY-SEQ-PROTO -- a general Y sequence with an implied X sequence.
   SPEC-SEQ-PROTO and various descendents - A spectrum of some
      sort ( XES, EELS ) including reference spectra for fit.
     ( This is the part I'm trying to refactor, to make some elements into
      mixin's, to make it easier to generalize new types. )

 * utility classes and functions:
     some miscellaneous utility functions and
     STATEFUL-PROTO
     XLINKABLE-PROTO
        mixin's to implement objects with state, which can propagate
        state changes to other linked objects, and a more general
        linking scheme that can link points to non-point objects,
        or objects to each other.
   ( I use it to link graphic overlay objects to points in a namelist,
     and to link data/observation points in a scatterplot to the
     original data -- for example, you should be able to click on
     an outlier point in a scatterplot of Calcium concentrations, and
     bring up a plot of the spectrum and the fit which produced that
     number to check it visually for anything odd. This last bit isn't
     implemented yet -- it's why I wanted the directory management
     functions so that I could set up several data directories to be
     searched automatically. )


 * graphics classes
      color graphics hierarchical overlay objects
 	( real-graph, rect, poly, oval, etc. & group )
      jitterplots ( & boxplots & oval-plots as overlays )
      & various mods to scatterplot-proto to handle overlays,
       color-backgrounds, color-grids, etc.
